# 💝 Valentine's Day Proposal Website

A playful, minimalist website to ask your girlfriend to be your Valentine!

## Page Layout & Design
- **Soft pastel pink background** with a clean, uncluttered layout
- Everything centered on the page for a simple, elegant feel
- Warm, friendly typography (rounded, playful font style)

## What She'll See When the Page Loads
1. **A cute puppy GIF** at the top — big pleading puppy eyes, begging for a "yes"
2. **"Will you be my Valentine?"** in large, friendly text below the puppy
3. **Two buttons**: a welcoming **"Yes"** button and a sneaky **"No"** button

## The Fun Interactive Bits

### The "No" Button (the star of the show 😄)
- When she hovers over "No," it **runs away** — jumping to a random spot on the screen
- Every time she tries to chase it, it escapes again
- The button gets smaller each time, making it even harder to catch
- Essentially **impossible to click** — playful and dramatic

### The "Yes" Button
- Grows slightly bigger each time the "No" button runs away (encouraging the right answer!)
- When clicked:
  - The puppy GIF and question fade out
  - **Confetti and hearts animation** fills the screen
  - A joyful message appears: **"Yay! You said yes! 💕"**
  - A celebratory GIF appears (hearts, dancing, etc.)
  - Background shifts to a warmer, more festive pink/rose tone

## Animations & Polish
- Smooth fade-in when the page loads
- Gentle floating hearts in the background for ambiance
- All transitions are smooth and delightful, not overwhelming
- Fully responsive — works great on her phone too
